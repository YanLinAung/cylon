                </header><p>Team <a href="http://cylonjs.com/" target="blank">Cylon.js</a> got back a few days ago from the first ever <a href="http://www.robotsconf.com/" target="blank">RobotsConf</a> last week. The brainchild of the influential Chris Williams aka <a href="https://twitter.com/voodootikigod" target="blank">@VoodooTikiGod</a> of <a href="http://www.jsconf.com/" target="blank">JSConf</a> renown, RobotsConf was planned to be the first conference to bring open source software developers in and have them leave as new hardware makers.</p>
                
                <p>Unlike a "normal" conference, the format for RobotsConf was to have just a few sessions to inspire creativity and provide some background on the first day, and then devote the rest of the conference to actually making things. Teams of language/subject matter experts (such as ourselves) had been invited to come and help everyone implement whatever it was they wanted to over the the 2 days of the conference. At the end, there would then be a "science faire" where everyone would get to show off their creations, and the "experts" would then judge the "winners". Very fun!</p>
                
                <p>This would be one of the defining characteristics of RobotsConf: the culture of fun and openness. It was delightful collaborating and interacting with so many people. Running around helping alongside the various team members of the <a href="https://twitter.com/nodebots" target="blank">@nodebots</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/nodecopter" target="blank">@nodecopter</a> teams, along with so many other brilliant humans. It was almost like a music festival attitude of jamming, but of hardware hacking, everyone excited to see what each other were doing.</p>
                
                <p>Thanks to a generous group of sponsors, fantastic hardware kits given to each attendee. It included a <a href="http://leapmotion.com/" target="blank">Leap Motion</a> controller, which was one of the most popular devices used at the conference. Our team had pushed an adaptor for <a href="http://leapmotion.com/" target="blank">cylon-leapmotion</a> a week before the conference, which really helped a lot of people get started quickly. Special thanks for the shout out during the Leap Motion team's workshop talk!</p>
                
                <p>The kits also included a brand new <a href="http://spark.io/" target="blank">Spark Core kit</a>, among the first given to anyone! The Spark team brought some of the first shipment of devices from their success Kickstarter campaign directly to RobotsConf. Team Cylon took that as a challenge, and we were able to push an adaptor (<a href="https://github.com/hybridgroup/cylon-spark" target="blank">cylon-spark</a>) within 24 hours. </p>
                
                <p>Lastly, the kits packed in an Arduino Uno and a bunch of sundry wires, cables, breadboards and stickers. You always need stickers!</p>
                
                <p>The conference had a dedicated hardware hacking room, with stations setup for soldering, robotics, 3-D printing, laser cutting, wearable computing and more. Not to mention gigantic piles of components, breakout boards, sensors, legos, and googly-eyes that were available for people to use on the projects they were building at the conference. This stop motion video of the first day captures a lot of the tremendous energy and enthusiam that everyone had at the conference.</p>
                
                <iframe width="100%" height="300px" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/xNyxqfTGXOo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
                
                <p>Next to the hardware hacking room was the drone hacking room with 50 <a href="http://ardrone2.parrot.com/" target="blank">ARDrones</a> ready for flight. Many people came thru and tried their code on programmatic flips, as well as even more impressive aerial stunts. Not all landings were smooth, but no humans were hurt in the process.</p>
                
                <p>We also had 30 <a href="http://www.gosphero.com/" target="blank">Sphero robots</a> thanks to our friends at Orbotix, plus some Crazyflie Nanodrones, a Roomba, and a few other specialized devices. Everything that Team Cylon.js had brought was available for people to "check out" library-style to use on their science fair robotics projects. Quite a few people "rolled" thru, and one of the winners did some really cool things with 2 Spheros and a Leap Motion.</p>
                
                <p>Another of the science faire winners was 12-year-old genius <a href="https://twitter.com/MakerSylvia" target="blank">@MakerSylvia</a> and her team. This video shows her flying an ARDrone controlled by a Leap Motion, and then using a Spark to release something while in mid-flight. And she was even sporting one of our Cylon.js t-shirts too. We're so proud! Here is a <a href="http://instagram.com/p/hoqO_dho-u/#" target="blank">brief video</a> showing her demo.</p>
                
                <p>Thank you so very much to everyone who took part in RobotsConf. It was incredibly fun and inspiring, and we cannot wait for the next one!</p>

                  </div>
                </header><p>As mentioned in our last blog post, we had a team demonstrating <a href="http://cylonjs.com/" target="blank">Cylon.js</a> at the <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/DF13/" target="blank">Dreamforce</a> conference in San Francisco last week. At over 130,000 people registered, it is one of the largest tech conferences in the world! We had received a special invitation to be part of the first <a href="http://blogs.developerforce.com/developer-relations/2013/10/every-internet-of-things-thing-at-dreamforce-2013.html" target="blank">Connected Device Lab</a> which was a unique location within the conference dedicated to important companies in the emerging "Internet of Things".</p>
                
                <p>The first day of the conference, we "unleashed" <a href="https://github.com/hybridgroup/cylon-force" target="blank">cylon-force</a>, an open-source adaptor that lets you connect a Cylon.js program to a Salesforce connected application. While many companies are still talking about the future, our hardworking team of humans and robots is already building the platform.</p>
                
                <p>Our team showed a demonstration that we called the "Robot Economy". We had some <a href="http://gosphero.com/" target="blank">Sphero robots</a> bounce around inside an enclosure, and every collision we counted as a virtual dollar earned. Like a robotic "fight club". Cylon.js would then upload that to a Salesforce connected application we nicknamed the "First Galactic Bank of Sphero". The sales totals we would then push to a <a href="http://getpebble.com/" target="blank">Pebble</a> smart watch, to a small app we had programmed using the new <a href="https://developer.getpebble.com/2/" target="blank">Pebble SDK 2.0 Beta</a>.</p>
                
                <p>In other words, we demoed Cylon.js combining Pebble wearable tech, Sphero connected devices, and a Salesforce line of business application. Live. As you might imagine, Dreamforce attendees went crazy! The future is already here, dear friends.</p>
                
                <p>Because we had so many hours of back to back demos (10+ hours a day!!!), we ended up demoing for thousands of people. Not kidding.</p>
                
                <p>But that was not enough for our intrepid team. The last 2 days, we raised the level, and added a <a href="http://bitcraze.se/" target="blank">Crazyflie nanocopter</a> into the mix. Whenever we flew the Crazyflie, we pushed data into the Salesforce connected app using our open source software. We had set up a "perimeter" of Spheros, and turned them red to warn the humans whenever the quadcopter was in flight, or green when the drone would land. We also pumped some of the telemetry info into the Pebble smart watch. The Dreamforce team was kind enough to let us out in front of the entire Connected Device Lab in the mornings before too much traffic made us retreat to the booth. First connected Salesforce drone? Yes!</p>
                
                <p>Thank you very much to <a href="https://twitter.com/ReidCarlberg" target="blank">Reid Carlberg</a> and everyone else at the Salesforce team who ran the Dreamforce Connected Device Lab, for a job well done. We appreciated being part of such a monumental event, and it should seem obvious now to everyone that devices are now a "thing".</p>

We have a workspace in the Developer Zone at the <a href="http://blogs.developerforce.com/developer-relations/2013/10/every-internet-of-things-thing-at-dreamforce-2013.html" target="blank">Connected Device Lab</a> on the second floor of Moscone West, and we're also <a href="https://dreamevent.my.salesforce.com/apex/ActivityList#a093000000XfGjrAAF" target="blank">leading a workshop</a> on the opening day of the conference. Both will include lots of <a href="http://gosphero.com/" target="blank">Sphero</a> fun thanks to our friends at Orbotix. We will have a bunch of great giveaways too! </p>
                
                <p>But don't be fooled, we're talking serious business, even if it comes in a rolling package. We will show you how easily you can use Cylon.js and Force.com together to integrate all kinds of devices that provide real-time business information. Cylon.js unleashes the power of JavaScript and <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="blank">Node.js</a> to help build the Internet of Things, and we will be using Spheros in a fun way, to teach developers how they can start making use of these new technologies.</p>
                
                <p>At our workshop, as well as over the course of the conference, we will show people how to use Cylon.js and Force.com together to integrate devices, using the Sphero 2.0 as our "minimum viable robot". Dreamforce is one of the largest technology conferences on Earth, and we are very honored and excited to be a part of it. If you are attending the conference, <a href="https://dreamevent.my.salesforce.com/apex/ActivityList#a093000000XfGjrAAF" target="blank">the session page is here</a>. See you in San Francisco!</p>

                </header><p>Welcome to the next era of open source robotics! This blog is where we will discuss new and interesting developments on Cylon.js (<a href="http://cylonjs.com" target="blank">http://cylonjs.com</a>) the new JavaScript robotics framework based on <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="blank">Node.js</a>, as well as anything else interesting to the robot community at large.</p>
                
                <p>We first introduced Cylon.js to the world at the <a href="http://js.la/" target="blank">Los Angeles JavaScript</a> meetup last month, held appropriately at <a href="http://www.idealab.com/" target="blank">Idealab</a> in Pasadena, CA. Yes, the same Pasadena where the legendary <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/index.php" target="blank">Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)</a> controls NASA robots currently on Mars. It was a great chance to share our work with the local community, and we were really excited and grateful for the wonderful response.</p>
                
                <p>Since then, our team has been working hard on the project, adding more hardware support, and we have so much more coming. We're really excited about where the Cylon.js project is going, and how we can use the power of JavaScript and Node.js for open source robotics. Please give Cylon.js a try, and help us make it the easiest, most flexible, and most powerful framework in JavaScript for robotics and physical computing.</p>
