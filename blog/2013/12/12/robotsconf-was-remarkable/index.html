              </header><p>Team <a href="http://cylonjs.com/" target="blank">Cylon.js</a> got back a few days ago from the first ever <a href="http://www.robotsconf.com/" target="blank">RobotsConf</a> last week. The brainchild of the influential Chris Williams aka <a href="https://twitter.com/voodootikigod" target="blank">@VoodooTikiGod</a> of <a href="http://www.jsconf.com/" target="blank">JSConf</a> renown, RobotsConf was planned to be the first conference to bring open source software developers in and have them leave as new hardware makers.</p>
              
              <p>Unlike a "normal" conference, the format for RobotsConf was to have just a few sessions to inspire creativity and provide some background on the first day, and then devote the rest of the conference to actually making things. Teams of language/subject matter experts (such as ourselves) had been invited to come and help everyone implement whatever it was they wanted to over the the 2 days of the conference. At the end, there would then be a "science faire" where everyone would get to show off their creations, and the "experts" would then judge the "winners". Very fun!</p>
              
              <p>This would be one of the defining characteristics of RobotsConf: the culture of fun and openness. It was delightful collaborating and interacting with so many people. Running around helping alongside the various team members of the <a href="https://twitter.com/nodebots" target="blank">@nodebots</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/nodecopter" target="blank">@nodecopter</a> teams, along with so many other brilliant humans. It was almost like a music festival attitude of jamming, but of hardware hacking, everyone excited to see what each other were doing.</p>
              
              <p>Thanks to a generous group of sponsors, fantastic hardware kits given to each attendee. It included a <a href="http://leapmotion.com/" target="blank">Leap Motion</a> controller, which was one of the most popular devices used at the conference. Our team had pushed an adaptor for <a href="http://leapmotion.com/" target="blank">cylon-leapmotion</a> a week before the conference, which really helped a lot of people get started quickly. Special thanks for the shout out during the Leap Motion team's workshop talk!</p>
              
              <p>The kits also included a brand new <a href="http://spark.io/" target="blank">Spark Core kit</a>, among the first given to anyone! The Spark team brought some of the first shipment of devices from their success Kickstarter campaign directly to RobotsConf. Team Cylon took that as a challenge, and we were able to push an adaptor (<a href="https://github.com/hybridgroup/cylon-spark" target="blank">cylon-spark</a>) within 24 hours. </p>
              
              <p>Lastly, the kits packed in an Arduino Uno and a bunch of sundry wires, cables, breadboards and stickers. You always need stickers!</p>
              
              <p>The conference had a dedicated hardware hacking room, with stations setup for soldering, robotics, 3-D printing, laser cutting, wearable computing and more. Not to mention gigantic piles of components, breakout boards, sensors, legos, and googly-eyes that were available for people to use on the projects they were building at the conference. This stop motion video of the first day captures a lot of the tremendous energy and enthusiam that everyone had at the conference.</p>

              <p>Next to the hardware hacking room was the drone hacking room with 50 ARDrones ready for flight. We also had 20 Sphero, plus some Crazyflie Nanodrones, a Roomba, and a few other specialized devices. Everything we had brought was available for "checking out" library style. Many people came thru and tried their code on programmatic flips, as well as even more impressive aeriel stunts. Not all landings were smooth, but no humans were hurt in the process.</p>
              
              <p>One of the science faire winners was 12-year-old genius <a href="https://twitter.com/MakerSylvia" target="blank">@MakerSylvia</a> and her team. This video shows her flying an ARDrone controlled by a Leap Motion, and then using a Spark to release somethig while in mid-flight. And she was even sporting one of our Cylon.js t-shirts too. We're so proud! Here is a <a href="http://instagram.com/p/hoqO_dho-u/#" target="blank">brief video</a> showing her demo.</p>
              
              <p>Thank you so very much to everyone who took part in RobotsConf. It was incredibly fun and inspiring, and we cannot wait for the next one!</p>
