            <p>For this Cylon example, we're going to run a version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game Of
            Life</a>, using Spheros as cells.</p>
            
            <p>To account for the fact that we're now using Spheros to play the game, we need
            to make some changes to the mechanics. Here's how our version of Conway's Game
            will go:</p>
            
            <ul>
<li>"alive" Spheros glow green, "dead" spheros glow red.</li>
              <li>At the start of the game, all Spheros are "alive".</li>
              <li>On every tick, the "alive" Spheros roll randomly, and count the number of
            collisions they have.</li>
              <li>After the tick, all the Spheros that had between two and six collisions are
            considered "alive", and those with less than two or more than six collisions
            are now "dead"</li>
              <li>If a "dead" Sphero is bumped into by an "alive" one, or has collisions through
            other means, it can become "alive" again.</li>
            </ul>
<p>With those alterations in hand, let's start building it with Cylon! Before you
            start, make sure you have the <code>cylon-sphero</code> module installed.</p>
            
            <p>First off, let's load up Cylon:</p>
            
            <pre class="CodeRay">Cylon = require 'cylon'
</pre>
            
            <p>We'll be using four robots for this example, but they'll have very similar
            programming so we just need to define what's different between them for now.
            Each of the robots will have a unique name, and will communicate on their own
            port.</p>
            
            <pre class="CodeRay">bots = [
  { port: '/dev/rfcomm0', name: 'Thelma' }
  { port: '/dev/rfcomm1', name: 'Louise' },
  { port: '/dev/rfcomm2', name: 'Grace' },
  { port: '/dev/rfcomm3', name: 'Ada' }
]
</pre>
            
            <p>For easier use later, let's define the colors we'll be using with the Spheros,
            green for alive and red for dead:</p>
            
            <pre class="CodeRay">Green = 0x0000FF
Red = 0xFF0000
</pre>
            
            <p>That gets the basics out of the way.</p>
            
            <p>Since, as previously mentioned, our robots all have the same basic
            functionality, we can define that functionality in a CoffeeScript class. Since
            we're feeling particularly creative today, let's call this class <code>ConwayRobot</code>:</p>
            
            <pre class="CodeRay">class ConwayRobot
</pre>
            
            <p>All of our robots will be connecting to a Sphero, and be operating via a single
            device (you guessed it, a Sphero).</p>
            
            <pre class="CodeRay">  connection: { name: 'Sphero', adaptor: 'sphero' }
  device: { name: 'sphero', driver: 'sphero' }
</pre>
            
            <p>When the robots are first started, they are born. This sets their contacts to
            zero, their age to zero, makes them "alive", and starts them moving for the
            first tick.</p>
            
            <pre class="CodeRay">  born: -&gt;
    @contacts = 0
    @age = 0
    @life()
    @move()
</pre>
            
            <p>When a robot is asked to move, it rolls in a random direction at speed 60.</p>
            
            <pre class="CodeRay">  move: -&gt;
    @sphero.roll 60, Math.floor(Math.random() * 360)
</pre>
            
            <p>In the case of our robots, "life" just means the robot's internal "alive" state
            is set to <code>true</code>, and the Sphero's LED is set to green.</p>
            
            <pre class="CodeRay">  life: -&gt;
    @alive = true
    @sphero.setRGB Green
</pre>
            
            <p>Similarly, "death" just sets the "alive" state to false, the Sphero's color to
            red, and stops the Sphero from moving.</p>
            
            <pre class="CodeRay">  death: -&gt;
    @alive = false
    @sphero.setRGB Red
    @sphero.stop()
</pre>
            
            <p>A robot is decided to have enough contacts if it has between two and six
            contacts.</p>
            
            <pre class="CodeRay">  enoughContacts: -&gt;
    if @contacts &gt;= 2 and @contacts &lt; 7 then true else false
</pre>
            
            <p>On a robot's birthday, it increments it's age, prints it's name, age, and
            contacts to the console, and then determines if it's now alive or dead based on
            the number of contacts it had in the last tick.</p>
            
            <pre class="CodeRay">  birthday: -&gt;
    @age += 1

    Logger.info "Happy birthday, \1@name}. You are \1@age} and had \1@contacts} contacts."

    if @enoughContacts()
      @rebirth() if not @alive?
    else
      @death()

    @contacts = 0
</pre>
            
            <p>Now that the pieces are there, we can set up our robot's work. It starts by
            being "born", then moves every three seconds if it's alive, celebrates it's
            birthday every ten seconds if it's alive, and increments it's contacts every
            time the Sphero detects a collision.</p>
            
            <pre class="CodeRay">  work: (me) -&gt;
    me.born()

    me.sphero.on 'collision', -&gt;
      @contacts += 1

    every 3.seconds(), -&gt;
      me.move() if me.alive?

    every 10.seconds(), -&gt;
      me.birthday() if me.alive?
</pre>
            
            <p>Now that we've defined the behaviour of our Conway's Game robots, we can make
            the robots themselves.</p>
            
            <p>For each of the sets of unique characteristics in the earlier <code>bots</code> array,
            we'll create a new <code>ConwayRobot</code>, assign it it's unique characteristics, and
            pass it to Cylon so it will keep track of them.</p>
            
            <pre class="CodeRay">for bot in bots
  robot = new ConwayRobot
  robot.connection.port = bot.port
  robot.name = bot.name
  Cylon.robot robot
</pre>
            
            <p>Now that Cylon knows about our robots and what they do, we can get started!</p>
            
            <pre class="CodeRay">Cylon.start()
